The Infinite Money Machine (ARGOS) now operates from secure servers around the world, democratizing algorithmic trading for anyone willing to learn. Castle Securities never discovers the theft - they just wonder why their "impossible" algorithm suddenly stops working. More importantly, you've developed a complete methodology for professional security testing that can be applied to any target.

**Final Operations:**
- Complete evidence removal from all compromised systems using automated cleanup scripts
- Secure exfiltration of the complete algorithm codebase through encrypted channels
- Professional documentation of all attack vectors and methods for future reference
- Establishment of the democratized Infinite Money Machine for ethical use

**Target Focus: Complete Castle Securities Assessment**
- End-to-end testing methodology applied to full application stack
- Professional reporting and client communication templates
- Systematic documentation of all findings across vulnerability categories
- Recommendations for ongoing security testing and remediation

**Professional Skills Developed:**
- Repeatable methodology for security assessments
- Integration with existing security tools and workflows
- Risk assessment and business impact analysis
- Professional communication and reporting
- Ethical considerations and responsible disclosure

**Technical Prerequisites:**
- Mastery of all previous chapters' techniques
- Understanding of business risk and impact assessment
- Professional communication skills
- Project management and documentation abilities

**Reality Check**: This chapter focuses on practical professional skills - workflows, reporting, and integration - rather than building enterprise platforms. These are immediately applicable skills for security professionals entering the field.
