# Modern Fuzz Testing

**Automating Resilience with AI, CI/CD, and Observability**

*From Individual Success to Organizational Security Programs*

**Target Audience:** Upper junior to mid-senior cybersecurity professionals and security-focused developers. Requires programming fundamentals (any language), basic command-line experience, and introductory security knowledge. Designed for practitioners who want to implement comprehensive vulnerability discovery programs.

**Book Description:** Security testing that relies on manual processes and basic scanning tools misses the vulnerabilities that cause the worst breaches. This book teaches coverage-guided fuzzing because automated discovery scales where manual testing fails, and enterprise integration ensures individual success becomes organizational security improvement.

Using the Castle Securities application portfolio - a realistic financial technology suite with intentionally vulnerable components designed for this book - you'll master the progression from basic AFL++ campaigns to enterprise-scale distributed fuzzing operations. Each technique builds naturally: coverage-guided discovery finds edge cases that random testing misses, automation enables scale that manual processes cannot achieve, and enterprise deployment transforms individual tools into organizational security improvement.

Following this progression, you'll develop from tool user to security program architect, capable of designing and deploying fuzzing programs that discover vulnerabilities at enterprise scale.
