**The Prize:**
You successfully use AFL++ to discover a buffer overflow in Castle Securities' custom avatar processing library (`avatar_parser.c`). The vulnerability exists in GIF comment parsing where a classic `strcpy()` operation doesn't validate input length, leading to stack corruption.

**Target Focus: Castle Securities Avatar Processing Library**
- `avatar_parser.c` - A deliberately vulnerable GIF parsing library used by their employee portal
- Stack buffer overflow in GIF comment parsing (classic `strcpy()` vulnerability)
- Integration point with web application file upload (Chapter 4 connection)
- Demonstrates both source code compilation with `afl-clang-fast` and binary-only testing with QEMU mode

**Technical Implementation:**
```c
// avatar_parser.c - deliberately vulnerable
void parse_gif_comment(char *comment_data, int length) {
    char buffer[100];  // Fixed size buffer
    strcpy(buffer, comment_data);  // No bounds checking!
    // ... rest of parsing logic
}
```

**Fuzzing Workflow:**
1. **Source code fuzzing**: Compile with `afl-clang-fast avatar_parser.c`
2. **Binary fuzzing**: Use AFL++ QEMU mode for compiled library
3. **Input generation**: Start with valid GIF files, mutate comment sections
