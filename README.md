Modern applications require automated resilience testing that goes beyond traditional security scanning to prevent costly service outages. This book teaches practical implementation of fuzzing tools through hands-on projects that guarantee vulnerability discoveries within 30 minutes. Learn to find real vulnerabilities in ImageMagick, discover Jinja2 template injection in FastAPI applications, and test JavaScript chatbot security using systematic exploration techniques.

You'll master AFL++, libFuzzer, FuzzTest, and OSS-Fuzz through practical examples including ImageMagick CVE discovery, FastAPI release server security testing, and cross-language FFI boundary testing. Each chapter includes Docker-containerized implementations with realistic vulnerable applications and clear success metrics. Build fuzzing infrastructure that integrates with existing development workflows and scales from individual testing to enterprise deployment.

By following this hands-on approach, you'll implement systematic vulnerability discovery that finds bugs before they reach production, integrate fuzzing into development workflows without disrupting productivity, and build security testing capabilities that demonstrate clear value through measurable results. You'll discover memory corruption in native code, template injection in Python services, and authentication bypasses in JavaScript applications.
